# MyShuttle-Java-App

This project involves setting up two servers: one for building the application and another for deploying it. The build server uses Maven, and the deploy server uses Apache Tomcat for hosting the `.war` file.

## Project Overview

- **Build Server**: Uses Maven to compile and package the Java application.
- **Deploy Server**: Uses Tomcat to deploy the `.war` file.

## Prerequisites

### Build Server

- Ubuntu (or a similar Linux distribution)
- OpenJDK 17
- Maven

### Deploy Server

- Ubuntu (or a similar Linux distribution)
- Apache Tomcat 9.x

## Build Server Setup

The following steps were followed to set up the build server:

1. **Update the system**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt -y update
    ```

2. **Clone the GitHub repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HoussemDellai/MyShuttle-Java-app.git
    ```

3. **Verify Java version**:
    ```bash
    java --version
    ```

4. **Install OpenJDK 17**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless
    ```

5. **Navigate into the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd MyShuttle-Java-app/
    ```

6. **Install Maven**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt -y install maven
    ```

7. **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    mvn clean package
    ```

    The Maven `clean` command removes previous build artifacts, and `package` compiles the code and packages it into a `.war` file.

8. **Verify the build output**:
    After running `mvn package`, the `.war` file will be available in the `target/` directory of the project.

## Deploy Server Setup

On the deploy server, Apache Tomcat was used to deploy the `.war` file generated by Maven.

1. **Install Apache Tomcat**:
   Download the Tomcat archive and unzip it:

    ```bash
    tar -xvzf apache-tomcat-9.0.110.tar.gz
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Tomcat `webapps` directory**:
    ```bash
    cd apache-tomcat-9.0.110/webapps/
    ```

3. **Transfer the `.war` file from the build server**:
    The `.war` file generated on the build server is transferred to the `webapps/` directory of the Tomcat server (this step could be done using `scp` or another file transfer method).

4. **Verify the `.war` file**:
    ```bash
    ls
    ```

    Ensure that the `.war` file (e.g., `myshuttledev.war`) is present in the `webapps/` folder.

5. **Start Tomcat**:
    Start the Tomcat server using the following command:
    ```bash
    ./bin/startup.sh
    ```

    This will deploy the `.war` file and make the application available on the server.

## Accessing the Application

Once the Tomcat server is running, you can access the application by navigating to the following URL:
